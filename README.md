===================

Tracking inmates in the Champaign County Jail system

Its beating heart is [the jail scraper](https://github.com/lashback/ChampaignCountyJail/blob/master/jail/apps/prisoners/management/commands/champaign_jail_scrape.py), influenced heavily by the neighboring [Cook County Jail scraper](https://github.com/sc3/cookcountyjail).

Currently set up as a cron job every two hours (courtesy of the [tutorial](http://kevin.schaul.io/2011/11/07/tutorial-web-scraping-with-django/) by [Kevin Schaul](https://github.com/kevinschaul))
